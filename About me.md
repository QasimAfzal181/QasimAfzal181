About me: 
I am a Computer Network Administrator (CNA) graduate from NAIT, passionate about IT, networking, and virtualization. 
My experience spans a wide range of technical skills, from managing Active Directory to working with Hyper-V and VMware environments.

Skills and Knowledge:
‚Ä¢ Active Directory: User and group management, permissions, and security policies.
‚Ä¢ Troubleshooting: Expertise in Windows clients, servers, networking issues, and documentation.
‚Ä¢ Networking: Basics of networking protocols and infrastructure.
‚Ä¢ Remote Desktop Connection: Setting up and managing remote access.
‚Ä¢ WDS (Windows Deployment Services): Setup and deployment of Windows systems.
‚Ä¢ SharePoint: Understanding its purpose and effectively utilizing it.
‚Ä¢ Microsoft 365: Familiar with tools like Teams, OneDrive, and Outlook.
‚Ä¢ Server Backup: Best practices for backing up Windows servers.
‚Ä¢ Linux: Fundamental knowledge for managing Linux-based systems.
‚Ä¢ Virtualization: Hands-on experience with Hyper-V, VMware vSphere, and ESXi servers.

üíª Python Projects (Assignments):

1. User Input with Error Detection
Objective:
‚Ä¢ Prompt users to enter two numbers and handle invalid input gracefully.
‚Ä¢ Display the smaller and larger number after comparison.
‚Ä¢ Allow users to type "quit" to exit the program.

Key Deliverables:
 ‚Ä¢ Flowchart in Visio.
 ‚Ä¢ Pseudocode matching the flowchart.

2. IPv4 Address Validation

Objective:
‚Ä¢ Validate an IPv4 address entered in dotted decimal format.
‚Ä¢ Ensure proper input handling, display validity, and allow users to exit the program by typing "quit".

Key Deliverables:
‚Ä¢ Flowchart illustrating the validation process.
‚Ä¢ Python program implementing the validation logic with clear documentation.


3. Advanced IPv4 Address Validation
   
Objective:

‚Ä¢ Enhance IPv4 validation by supporting flexible separators (periods, spaces, commas).
‚Ä¢ Include functionality to determine the address class, generate a binary representation, and display detailed information.
‚Ä¢ Modularize the code with at least four functions (e.g., getip(), validateip(), errormessage(), showipinfo()).

Key Deliverables:
‚Ä¢ Python program with modular, structured, and well-documented code.
‚Ä¢ File Management: Tools for file operations and organization.
‚Ä¢ Command Line Argument Parser: Handling files through command-line arguments.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. File Processing with Command-Line Arguments
Objective:
 ‚Ä¢ Create a Python program to read, modify, and write file content based on command-line arguments.
 ‚Ä¢ Handle file existence, default directories, and user interactions for overwriting files or creating new ones.

Key Deliverables:
‚Ä¢ Python program with modular code.
‚Ä¢ Features include:
‚Ä¢ Generating file headers with system info, username, and timestamp.
‚Ä¢ Writing prefixed content to an output file with error handling.
‚Ä¢ Video showcasing program functionality.


5. Py to Exe:
Objective:
‚Ä¢ Develop a Python program that takes one or more command line arguments, prompts the user for something, does some calculations or processing, and writes a file.
‚Ä¢	This program must be converted to and function as an executable.

Key Features:
‚Ä¢ Command-Line Arguments: Accepts input file paths and output file paths as command-line arguments.
‚Ä¢ User Interaction: Prompts the user for additional input, which modifies the content of the input file or affects calculations.
‚Ä¢ File Processing: Reads content from the input file, processes it based on user input, and writes the result to an output file.
‚Ä¢ File Writing: Includes error handling for file existence and writes content with a timestamp and system info in the header.
‚Ä¢ Executable Conversion: The Python script is converted into a standalone executable file using PyInstaller for cross-platform compatibility.
  
üåê Virtualization Projects
‚Ä¢Hyper-V Environment: Built a functional environment to test and deploy virtual machines.



üöÄ Capstone Project
 Project1000: Collaborated in a team of 5 to create a network virtual infrastructure supporting:
 ‚Ä¢ Over 350 users.
 ‚Ä¢ 6 clients.
 ‚Ä¢ Various services to manage and maintain the environment efficiently.
